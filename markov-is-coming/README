To complete this task, I read from a file a matrix encoded in decimal, representing the maze of this problem. Therefore, using this maze, I will construct an adjacency matrix by utilizing the initial element converted to binary and comparing it with the next element as follows: the compared element is the one above the initial element, where I check bit 1 (the wall above) or the one to the right by checking bit b3 (the wall to the right). Additionally, I also consider the case where I am on the row/column corresponding to the WIN or LOSE state and will include this position in the adjacency matrix.

Next, I will form a Link matrix, which is constructed similarly to the adjacency matrix, except that each element is divided by the number of 1s on each row. For example, if row 1 has 3 elements of 1, those will be divided by 3. Furthermore, this construction will help me in the continuation of this task by determining the Jacobi parameters: G represents the Link matrix without the last 2 rows and 2 columns, and c represents the column of the "WIN" state. Thus, I will be able to construct a probability vector using the Jacobi method.

Having this probability vector, a starting position, and the adjacency matrix, I can use the Heuristic-Greedy algorithm to create the most convenient path to the WIN state. Finally, I will decode this path, which strictly represents the position of a given element in the maze by counting from the first element to the position provided by the previous algorithm, and I will transform it into the (x, y) coordinates in the Maze matrix.
